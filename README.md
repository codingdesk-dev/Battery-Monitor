# Battery Monitor

Battery Monitor is a lightweight application designed to help you manage your device's battery status efficiently.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor your battery charge level in real-time.
- **Alert Notifications**: Receive alerts when your battery is fully charged or running low.
- **Optimize Battery Usage**: Take actions to optimize battery usage and prolong battery lifespan.

## How It Works

Battery Monitor continuously monitors your device's battery status. When the battery is fully charged, you'll receive a notification prompting you to unplug the charger to prevent overcharging. Similarly, when the battery level is low, Battery Monitor alerts you to plug in the charger to avoid sudden shutdowns.

## System Requirements

- Requires Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the Battery Monitor repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`psutil` and `plyer`).
3. Run the `battery_monitor.py` script.

## Usage

Simply run the `battery_monitor.py` script, and Battery Monitor will start monitoring your battery status in the background. You'll receive notifications when necessary.
